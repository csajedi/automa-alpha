# The Automacoin volunteer computing of the empirical distribution

This project's goal is to enable users of average means and sophistication to participate in the collection of turing machine outputs. The initial release will focus on filling in the D(0-10,2) sets and producing csv files for use with [pybdm](https://github.com/sztal/pybdm).


## Components

The project has two resources to balance: compute and storage. For this phase, storate will either be managed by the main contributers and developer or on AWS with a [grant](https://aws.amazon.com/grants/) Progress will be tracked in this repo.
